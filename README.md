#Intrinsic value estimator
In this tiny hobby project I'm trying to 
**estimate the value of items** in this case from finn.no data 
and compare them to the real price. 
By doing this its quicker to make good decisions when making purchases online.

So far, the program "main.py" fetches all the articles on a specified searchpage url on finn, scrapes the HTML and finally outputs some info from each page such as adress, price and description into one single csv file called data5.csv
